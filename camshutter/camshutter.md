# Camera Global vs. Rolling Shutting

               | Global | Rolling |
               | ------ | ------- |
moving objects |   +    |   -     |
heat           |   -    |   +     |
noise          |   -    |   +     |

logistics has fast moving objects

synchronization trigger reduces frame rate of rolling shutter by two

## Blur

exposure time t <= L / (pv) for 0.01p blur, e.g., 100ms exposure for 0.5m object moving at 0.5m/s

## Skew

rolling shutter top row to bottom row is about 33ms so for 0.5m/s object, about 1.5cm roll between top and bottom roll
