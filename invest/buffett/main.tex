Warren Buffett has beaten the SP500 about 87\% of the time during the years 1976--2006 by an average of about 11\% \cite{martin2008imitation}.  In that period Buffett held about 335 stocks for a median of about 18 months.  The largest five holdings account for about 73\% of the portfolio.  The portfolio is concentrated in manufacturing, finance, and utilities, with percentages of 42\%, 21\%, and 16\%, respectively.  A copycat portfolio using information from SEC 13F filings in the following quarter also beat the SP500 by an average of about 10.75\%.
