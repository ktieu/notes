# Value

An asset increase in value over time without any time or effort.

e.g., a stock

Investing means buying an asset whose price < value.

Owning a stock meanings owning a share of a business.

# Business

owner, business, customers

revenue = customer_expenditure

net_income = revenue - cost

e.g., net_income = revenue - labor_cost - material_cost - land_cost

earnings = net_income / time_period

price  = earnings / return

e.g., 200K = 20K / 10%

so return = earnings / price = 1 / (price / earnings) = 1 / PE

e.g., return = 1 / 15 = 6.67%

in stocks, dividend is earnings paid out to owners

## Economy as Machine

By Ray Dalio.

1. Productivity Growth
2. Short Term Debt Cycle
3. Long Term Debt Cycle

### Transactions

Economy = set of transactions

transaction involves buyer and seller

pay money, credit
get goods, services, financial assets

total spending = money + credit

price = total spent / total quantity

Market = buyers and sellers

people, businesses, governments

government is biggest buyer and seller
central government collects taxes and spends money
central bank controls amount of money and credit by setting interet rates and printing money

### Credit

credit is the biggest and most volatile part of economy

lender and borrower

borrower pays principal and interest in the future

credit is created by lender and borrower and becomes debt as asset to lender and liability to borrower

borrower + credit = increased spending -> increased income for seller

creditworthy borrower has ability to repay and collateral

### Cycles

credit matters in the short run, while productivity growth matters in the long run

debt swings cycle of 5--8 years

borrowing causes cycles

borrow from future self because spend more now and spend less later

more credit -> more spending -> more income

#### Short Term Debt Cycle

expansion fueled by credit, prices rise -> inflation -> FED raises interest rate -> less borrowing -> less spending -> less income -> deflation -> recession -> FED lowers interest rate -> more borrowing -> expansion -> ...

#### Long Term Debt Cycle

Short term memory causes bubble

debt burden = debt / income

prices soar

deleveraging: debt repayment -> less borrowing -> less spending -> less income -> less spending, less income, credit disappears, asset prices drop, stock market collapses

deleveraging can cause depression

responses to deleveraging:
cut spending, but reduces income
reduce debt
redistribute wealth, but social unrest
print money, to buy government bonds so government can spend money, but causes inflation

leveraging 50 years
depression 2--3 years
reflation 7--10 years
