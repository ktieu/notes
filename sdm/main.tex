"Sparse Distributed Memory" by Pentti Kanerva, 1988.

computational model of memory

"...memory items should be arranged in such a way that most items are unrelated to one another but most pairs of items can be linked by just one or two intermediate items."

"...some links (i.e., associations) are learned, but others are a property of the mathematical space for memory items."

"...patterns serve as addresses to memory..."

memory as content-addressable and associative

memory items represented as n-bit words with n in range of 100 to 10000.

"...no fundamental distinction between addresses to memory and the data stored in the storage locations; the data stored in memory are addresses to the memory."
